      <h3>R99</h3>

        <p>
          The R-99 is rightly feared and coveted by a majority of Apex Legends
          players, rightly so as the fastest-firing gun in the game. This quick
          and deadly SMG is capable of tearing apart a full armoured opponent in
          less than a second, provided you hit your shots. Our Apex Legends R-99
          guide will walk you through various useful things to know about this
          supremely potent SMG, from damage and fire rate to time-to-kill (TTK)
          stats. So let’s get started, and see why the R-99 is the favourite SMG
          of many an Apex Legends veteran.

      <h3>Alternator</h3>

      <p>
        The Alternator has been on quite a journey through the Seasons,
        beginning as one of the worst full-auto weapons in the game, then being
        buffed to ludicrous degrees thanks to the Disruptor Rounds Hop Up – and
        nowadays back to pretty much where it began. But in skilled hands, it
        can still hold its own in a firefight, just like any other weapon. Our
        Apex Legends Alternator guide will go through the various basic stats of
        this automatic SMG, before delving into the gun’s time-to-kill (TTK)
        stats under different circumstances.

      <h3>RE-45</h3>

      <p>
        With Season 2, Respawn elevated one of the lowest rungs of the Apex
        weapons ladder, the RE-45, to towering heights with the incredibly
        powerful Disruptor Rounds Hop Up. With Season 3, that Hop Up vanished,
        and with it the RE-45’s brief time in the sun. But that doesn’t mean it
        can’t shred an opponent under the right circumstances.

      <h3>Havoc</h3>

        <img

      </div>
      <p>
        The Havoc is different in quite a few ways from the other Assault Rifles
        – and all the other guns in Apex Legends, to be honest. Below we’ve put
        together a concise list of everything you need to know to start using
        and killing with this new weapon. Respawn have described the Havoc as a
        gun which “packs a punch” and has “multiple personalities”, both of
        which are certainly true. However, more than almost any other gun in
        Apex Legends, the Havoc is not a weapon that’s easy to get to grips
        with. Let’s take a look at the stats and see what exactly at work here.
